# Book Recommender System Using OpenAI and LangChain

## Overview
This project develops a sophisticated Book Recommender System leveraging OpenAI's language models and the LangChain library. It's designed to suggest books based on user preferences, utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques.


## Data Acquisition
The heart of the system lies in its dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Loading the dataset
books = pd.read_csv('data/BooksDatasetClean.csv')
```
This dataset, ideally sourced from a comprehensive collection like Kaggle, includes critical information such as titles, authors, descriptions, categories, and publication details.



## Data Preprocessing
The dataset I used for this project, from Kaggle, titled "Books Dataset" by Elvin Rustam, is a comprehensive collection of books, encompassing various details such as titles, authors, descriptions, categories, publishers, prices, and publication dates. The dataset is extensive, covering a broad spectrum of literature, making it a valuable resource for projects involving book recommendations, literary analysis, or data-driven studies in publishing trends (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinrustam/books-dataset?resource=download)

The data is already cleaned to eliminate symbols and have uniform capitalization. Additonally, I got rid of all books with no descriptions. This left me with roughly 70,000 books to train on.

In order to simply the data for embeddings later on, I combine all Title, Author, Description, and Category, into one column for simplicity and efficiency.

## Embedding and Vectorization
The system uses OpenAI's model for embedding textual data, transforming the textual information of each book into a numerical format:

```python
# Function to get embeddings
def get_embeddings(text_list, model="text-embedding-3-large"):
    processed_texts = [text.replace("\n", " ") for text in text_list]
    response = client.embeddings.create(input=processed_texts, model=model)
    return [item.embedding for item in response.data]
```

The selection of the "text-embedding-3-large" model for generating text embeddings is influenced by several key considerations. Larger models, such as this one, typically offer more advanced language comprehension capabilities. This leads to richer and more nuanced embeddings, capturing the complexities of the text more effectively.


This transformation is crucial for enabling the recommendation algorithm to understand and compare book content effectively.

## LangChain Integration
**LangChain** is a toolkit for building applications with language models, enabling complex tasks like text generation and information retrieval. **LanceDB** complements it by efficiently managing and querying textual data. 

Their use in my project enhances the capabilities of a book recommender system, offering advanced text processing and efficient data handling.
Integrating LangChain and LanceDB, the system creates a retrieval-based question-answering system. I used the following the libaries:

```python
import lancedb
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import LanceDB # Utilizes LanceDB for storing and retrieving the vector representations (embeddings) of the books.
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
```

**langchain.chains.RetrievalQA**: Part of LangChain, this module is used to build a retrieval-based question-answering system, enabling the book recommender to understand user queries and fetch relevant book recommendations based on the embeddings.
This setup enables the system to understand user queries about book preferences and search through the embedded book dataset to find relevant recommendations.

## Recommender System in Action
The recommender system processes user queries, searching the database for books that match the query's intent and context:

```python
query = "I'm looking for a mystery novel set in Victorian England."
docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query, k=3)
```
The output is a list of recommended books with relevant details, tailored to the user's preferences.
## LLM Chain
An LLM (Large Language Model) Chain is a sequence of operations combining the power of large-scale language models with structured querying to deliver accurate and relevant book recommendations. The chain I implemented uses a PromptTemplate to guide the language model with specific instructions for book recommendations, ensuring the output is structured and directly addresses user queries. This method leverages the language model's understanding of text to match books to users' tastes, as exemplified below. My choice of this approach allows for dynamic and context-aware recommendations, making it a powerful tool in the domain of personalized book discovery.

### Technical Summary of LLM Chain Implementation

In this project, the `LLMChain` from the `langchain` library is used to create an interactive book recommendation system. The `PromptTemplate` class structures the input to the language model, crafting a conversation-like exchange where the model plays the role of a recommender:

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
template = """You are a book recommender system that help users to find books that match their preferences. 
Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. 
For each question, suggest three books, with a short description of the plot and the reason why the user might like it.
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

Question: {question}
Your response: """
"  # A detailed prompt template for the LLM.
PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    template=template, input_variables=["question"])
```

The `LLMChain` is then instantiated with the `OpenAI` class from `langchain_openai`. This chain encapsulates the logic to interact with OpenAI's powerful language models:

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

#model is gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct
llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=api_key)
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=PROMPT, llm=llm)
```

The choice of `LLMChain` and `OpenAI` integration allows for the leveraging of GPT-3's deep understanding of language nuances, enabling the system to generate personalized book suggestions based on a user's query, as seen here:

```python
question = "i want a book about a girl who falls in love with a vampire..."
response = llm_chain.run(question)
```

This implementation details why `langchain` and `OpenAI` were chosenâ€”maximizing the ability to provide nuanced and contextually relevant book recommendations.
