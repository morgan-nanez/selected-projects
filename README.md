# Overview

This repo that contains projects I either did alone or contributed heavily. Each project is within it's respective folder. For specific project code email morgan.nanez@gmail.com. The projects span my undergraduate time a Berkeley and my time as a Master's at Princeton

## Repository Structure

### Computer Vision

In the `Computer Vision` directory, you'll find my projects and experiments with image data. This includes initial explorations into image recognition, object detection, and various applications of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

### General ML

The `General ML` folder contains a wide range of machine learning projects. These reports highlight my ability to apply general machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques across different datasets.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The `Natural Language Processing` section demonstrates my experience with textual data. Here, you will find projects involving language models, sentiment analysis, text classification, and other NLP applications. This includes my final reports detailing the implementation, challenges faced, and the insights gained from these models.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Proficient in Python and popular data science libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Strong foundation in machine learning theory and practical application.
- Experience in preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing complex datasets to derive actionable insights.
- Ability to communicate findings clearly through comprehensive reports and presentations.
